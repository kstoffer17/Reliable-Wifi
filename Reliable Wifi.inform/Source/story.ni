"Reliable Wifi" by kstoffer17

When play begins: 
    now left hand status line is "Exits: [exit list]"; 
    now right hand status line is "[location]".
To say exit list: 
	let place be location; 
	repeat with way running through directions: 
		let place be the room way from the location; 
		if place is a room, say " [way]".
		
MyRoom is a room. 





Starbucks is a south of door
