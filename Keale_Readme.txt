\f1\fs24 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 	I set out to create a game that incorporates my prompt, "Reliable WiFi". Also, I set out to create some action and I did this in a form of attacking. Ultimately, the game accomplishes what I set out to do.\
\
	I had many challenges and problems where I got stuck during the creation of my Final Inform Project. For instance, I had a problem with having scenery (the WiFi) in two different rooms (McDonalds and Starbucks). First, I went on the wiki to learn how to do this, but when I incorporated it I had problems. It took a great deal of time and help (Mr. and Ms. Kiang) to fix this. \
 \
	My 1st puzzle is a door and key puzzle. Basically, the player has to examine the desk, and open the drawer to find the key that will open the door connecting to the Boss's Office. The 2nd puzzle I have in my game is a darkness puzzle. Basically, the player has to find the flashlight, and know where (in the Electric Room) in order to succeed. My 3rd and final puzzle is my NPC (Hal). In other words, the player has to find the gun, talk to the NPC in order to kill the NPC. \
\
	The gameplay mechanics in my game are apparent. For example, I have navigation, failure, and accomplishment dynamics in my game. The navigation being the darkness in the Electric Room. Secondly, the failure being the NPC if you decide to attack without the gun. \
\
	During the day we had the Beta tests. I had a conflict so I was not able to have one of my classmates test my game. So I had one of friend's test my game. The feedback affected my game in a positive way because I was able to get multiple perspectives on the way my game was. Not only this, but I was able to do some minor fixes, as well as touch up on the descriptions. \
\
	I was able to give Cole Hulick feedback on his game. For example, I gave him feedback on the way his puzzles worked in his game. Not only this, but also what he should name his objects because in his game it was difficult to make things work. For instance, there was a bridge that you had to say exactly cross bridge in order to cross it. You could not say walk on bridge or walk over bridge. These are only a couple things I helped Cole with.\
\
	I am most proud of the descriptions in my game. In fact, in both my games, the House and this one, I am proud of my descriptions because they were really well thought-out. \
\
	Next time, I would probably try to create a game with even more difficult puzzles. This is because in my game I have a couple easy puzzles and only a few difficult ones. If I had the chance to do this again, I feel that a few more difficult puzzles would make it more challenging and interesting. }
